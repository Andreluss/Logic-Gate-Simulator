## User manual

Welcome to the user manual of our program. It is a comprehensive logic gate simulator with a stylish UI.
The program allows you to create logic circuits of any complexity and save these projects as both new projects and new gates, which you can later use to create further circuits.
The program, in addition to the basic functionality, provides the user with many other functions:
1. The user can edit each of the gates created by themselves and each of the projects (the gates can also change color and name after their initial selection).
2. The user can move around the infinite workspace by scrolling the mouse wheel, or by holding the middle mouse button and moving it.
3. The user can choose whether they want to see gate descriptions and can edit them.
4. The user can choose whether they want the circuit elements to be automatically arranged on a virtual grid or not.
5. The user can choose whether they want the inputs and outputs to automatically stick to the left and right side of the program, or whether they prefer to arrange them themselves.
6. The user can turn on and off full-screen mode.
7. The user can change the option of individual circuit elements by right-clicking.
8. The user can add inputs and outputs in two ways: they can drag them from the lower container, or right-click in the input/output area and select the option that interests them.
